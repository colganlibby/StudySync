# üìö StudySync ‚Äì UX Design Case Study  
*A chill productivity tool for students who want to get things done without burning out*

>**Note:** This project is currently in development. Final wireframes, Figma prototypes, and visuals will be added soon!

## Problem

Students often struggle to focus consistently and balance work with self-care. Many productivity apps feel overwhelming, guilt-inducing, or too rigid. **StudySync** is designed to make studying feel softer, more supportive, and social.

## üéØ Goals

- Help students track tasks and focus sessions with ease  
- Encourage healthy breaks and mood awareness  
- Enable peer accountability through simple "study sync" mode

---

## Target Users

- University students, especially those with ADHD or burnout  
- People who benefit from visual timers and gentle motivation  
- Anyone who prefers minimalist, friendly tools
